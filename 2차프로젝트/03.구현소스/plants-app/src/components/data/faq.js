    question: "How quickly can I feel the effects?",
    answer:
      "The timeframe for feeling the effects of herbal tinctures can differ. Factors like your unique response, the herb used, and the nature of your concern all play a role. Some notice changes right away, while for others, it's a gradual process. Using tinctures consistently is key, and their direct absorption into the bloodstream can offer quicker results. If you have specific questions, reaching out to a healthcare professional or herbalist is advisable.",

    question: "How should I take tinctures?",
    answer:
      "For optimal absorption, place the recommended dose under your tongue (sublingually) and hold it there for about 30 seconds to a minute before swallowing. This allows the active compounds to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream. If the taste is too intense, you can mix the tincture with a beverage like water, juice, or tea. Consistency is key.",

    question: "Are your tinctures alcohol free?",
    answer:
      "Yes! I've struggled with alcohol intolerance since I was in my early 20s and found it extremely frustrating that most tinctures I found on the market were alcohol based. I wanted to use herbs in the tincture form for maximum bioavailability but it has always been a struggle to find alcohol free tinctures.  <br> Not anymore! We got a Master Herbalist on board and he made sure that our tinctures deliver all of the benefits of alcohol based tinctures, without the strong taste (or alcohol). Also, this way, we are mindful of everyone who can't have alcohol-based tinctures because of health issues, addiction issues or religious beliefs. Inclusivity! Yey!",
